# Number-Facts-API

An API for interesting trivia and math facts about numbers. :tada: Fun to include in birthday cards! 

This RESTful API was created using Node.js and Express.js. This respository was created by following along Andrew Bliss' tutorial at [RapdiAPI Blog](https://rapidapi.com/blog/nodejs-express-rest-api-example/).

#### Two minor changes/fixes:
* In `/index.js` line 16, while using express middleware one should specifiy the required module's name instead of the module's path.	
* In `/routes/facts.js`, added definition for filePath for POST, UPDATE and DELETE methods.
